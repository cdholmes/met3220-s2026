    "\n",
    "In this task, you will create a function that counts the number of digits in an integer. For example, 64532 contains 5 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be useful to recognize that floor division by 10 (i.e. `number // 10`) drops the least significant digit from an integer. For example, `64532 // 10` yields `6453`. For positive integers, the number of digits equals the number of times that we can perform floor division by 10 before reaching 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps for designing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment with floor division by 10 to convince yourself that this works for counting digits. (nothing to turn in for this part)\n",
    "2. Write a loop that counts the number of times that you can perform floor division until the result is zero. (Hints are provided below.)\n",
    "3. Test your code with several positive integers to ensure that it works (e.g. 1, 2, 123, 1234).  \n",
    "4. Encapsulate your digit-counting code in a function. Name the function `count_digits`. The function should take a number as an input parameter and returns the number of digits as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: (after you have solved other problems in this assignment) Test if your function can count the digits of negative integers. If necessary, make changes so that it works for positive and negative integers.\n",

    "<li> Create a variable named `count` with an initial value of 0.</li>\n",
    "<li> Use a loop to increment `count` each time that you drop a digit.</li>\n",
